                                    <br>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who 
            served as the chairman
            and CEO of IBM.[1][2] He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed
            IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company
            into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-m
            ade industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he
            died in 1956.
